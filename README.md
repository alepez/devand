# DevAndDev

**UPDATE 2024-03-04**

We are sad to announce that effective immediately, the related website for this project has been shut down. After
careful consideration, we have decided to archive this project and cease further development.

The primary reason for this decision was the lack of an adequate user base to keep the project alive. Despite our best
efforts to promote and engage with the community, we were unable to garner enough traction to sustain the project's
growth.
