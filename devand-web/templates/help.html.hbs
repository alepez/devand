  <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

  <h3>What is DevAndDev?</h3>
  <p>DevAndDev helps developers of any level finding the perfect companion
     for pair-programming. Let us know what are your favorite languages and
     in which days of week and hours of day you are available for some
     pair-programming and we will try to find the best match</p>

  <h3>Will DevAndDev spam me?</h3>
  <p>We do the best to send you as few as possible email notifications. If you
     have a verified email, we will send you a notification when you receive
     messages from other users</p>

  <h3>Is my email address visible to other users?</h3>
  <p>No. We just send an email with a link to our chat, so you can chat with
     other users through our website</p>

  <h3>Does DevAndDev provide video conference tools?</h3>
  <p>No. We just match users. You can use you favorite video conference / code
     sharing tool. Just use our chat to exchange links or invitations to virtual
     rooms</p>

  <h3>What is language level?</h3>
  <p>For each language you can set three levels: <em>Novice</em>, <em>Proficient</em>, <em>Expert</em>.
     We will try to match you with a developer of the same level. You may be matched with
     programmers of different level, depending on other factors, like availability or
     priority.</p>

  <h3>What is language priority?</h3>
  <p>For each language you can set three priorities: <em>High</em>, <em>Low</em>, <em>No</em>.
     Set <em>High</em> if you really enjoy working with that language, whatever
     your level is. Set <em>Low</em> if it's not your best choice, but
     you are fine working with it if there aren't other developers who loves
     your favorite (yet exotic) language. Set <em>No</em> if you want other
     users know your skills, but you absolutly don't want to work with it.</p>

  <h3>My favorite language is not available!</h3>
  <p>Just <a href="https://github.com/alepez/devand/issues">file an issue</a>
     or <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request"> create a pull request</a>
     and we will be happy to add it!</p>

  <h3>Why all times are in UTC?</h3>
  <p>Because you will deal with developers from all over the world and keeping
     updated with all local times can be frustating for humans (and painful
     for programs)</p>
